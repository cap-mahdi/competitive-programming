/*
    Problem: Given an array of n integers, find the number of inversions in the array.
    Inversion Count for an array indicates â€“ how far (or close) the array is from being sorted.
    Formally speaking, two elements a[i] and a[j] form an inversion if a[i] > a[j] and i < j

    Approach: We can solve this problem using fenwick tree.(or even segment tree)
    1- We will sort the array and store the index of each element in the sorted array.//THAT TRICK IS ALWAYS USED IN QUERY PROBLEMS
    2- We will iterate over the sorted array and for each pair we will count the number of elements in the range [i+1,n-1] that are visited (1 for visited and 0 for not visited)[it like counting the number of elements that are samaller than the current element and are on the right side of the current element] and add it to the answer. and then we will mark the current element as visited.

    At each time we will run query to find the sum and then update the tree.That's why we use fenwick tree.(or segment tree)


    Time Complexity: O(nlogn)
    Space Complexity: O(n)
